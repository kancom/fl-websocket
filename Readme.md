==================================================
evaluation task
==================================================
an application or tool that can be automated to connect to an existing websocket, allow two-way communication, and ultimately store data from the websocket into a postgreSQL database.

Acceptance Criteria:

a) connect
b) allow us to send commands and
c) store response in postgreSQL.

Regarding the other requests except the login, Please assume that the request body come from the client app

So you can just parse it to the WS connection


The main goal of this POC is the login and keep the connection
